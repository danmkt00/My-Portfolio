## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- As a user, I want to navigate easily so i need a navbar
- As a user, I want to see an introduction in the portfolio, so that I can
  quickly understand what the developer does, what their motivations are, and
  easily find their social links.
- As a user, I want to see the developer's skills, so that I can easily
  understand their development expertise and what technologies they are
  proficient in.
- As a user, I want to see a section that showcases the developer's work, so
  that I can view one of the projects theyâ€™ve worked on, get a better sense of
  their experience and capabilities, and have a button to check the project
  online.
- As a user, I want to see a about section, so that I can understand their
  background, motivations, and what led them to pursue front-end development.
- As a user, I want to see a contact section where I can easily find the
  developer's email and links to their social profiles, so that I can reach out
  or connect with them.
